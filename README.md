# ALLocate

Files for region classification CNN training are in region_cnn directory. Central code used to generate plots and visualizations of model performance and results in main, including full pipeline sample implementation.

Use a weights file (.keras, .h5, etc.) for the region classifier and a .pt weights file for the YOLO cell classifier. Run ALLocate_software.py for the full pipeline detection capability.
